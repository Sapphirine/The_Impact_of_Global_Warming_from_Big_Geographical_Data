The Impact of Global Warming from Big Geographical Data
~~~~
Project Description
~~~~
The issue of Global Warming has been a controversial topic over the past decades. President-elect even claimed it is a made-in-China topic. The impact of global warming can truly be devastating to our planet. 
For example, 40% of population in the Netherlands are exposed to the risk of drowning. 
Growing sea level resulted from global warming can lead to submerging cityâ€™s land like Manhattan. We are looking for evidence from big geographical data, evaluating the impact of global warming and Mr. Trump statement as well.

Data<br />
[Climatology Data from NOAA](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/access/index.html)<br />
[Global Surface Temperature Data from NASA](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)<br />
[Sea Level Trends Data from NOAA] (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends.html)<br />
[Sea Level Trends Data From PSMSL](http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/)<br />

Code Description<br />
Scala:
~~~~
The code is used to to generate the respective temperature and sea level prediction model and the platform was Spark.It utilizes ML-Lib Library.
~~~~
MATLAB:
~~~~
The predict everything.m file is simply to take all the parameters from trained model from Scala, and then to visually show how the prediction is made and what relationships it has between data and predictions.
~~~~
Python:
~~~~
This code will take in the csv file of NOAA Climatology Data and will generate the latitude and longitude data.
~~~~

Model Generated:
~~~~
The respective model with respective coefficients generated.
~~~~
